# 3D avoider

This is a 3d avoider game made with VPython.
In the game, if you hit the white boxed or the red spheres (mines), then you lose.
Collect the yellow coins to get more score.
Survive as long as you can.

Use the arrow keys to move, A to go up, and Z to go down.
To compile the code, you will need to install VPython version 6.
